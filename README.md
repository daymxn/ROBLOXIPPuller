# Overview

Pull the Server IP of any ROBLOX game you are currently in.

# Why

This is an old project made by daymxn a couple years back.
Recently finding this I wanted to fix it as his old method he used didn't work

Using the old method directly finding %AppData% doesnt work. For some reason looping through the "logs" folder and finding the the file you want works

# Instructions

1. Open "ROBLOX IP Puller.exe"
2. Join a ROBLOX game
3. Wait until your character has spawned into the game
4. Click "Get Server IP"
5. You should get a popup window with the server's IP.
